# **AI Job Simulation at Cognizant (Virtual)**
Welcome to the repository documenting my virtual AI job simulation experience at Cognizant, completed through the Forage platform. This repository contains materials, code, and documentation related to the tasks undertaken during the simulation. Below is an overview of the simulation tasks and the work accomplished for each one.

# **Tasks Undertaken**

## **Task One:** Exploratory Data Analysis
- conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data using Python to uncover insights and patterns.

## **Task Two:** Data Modelling
- Reviewed a data model diagram to understand the structure and relationships within the data.
- Developed a strategic plan to address the client's problem statement.
- Crafted a PowerPoint slide summarizing the plan for presentation to my leader.

## **Task Three:** Model Building and Interpretation
- Utilized Python to construct a data model aimed at addressing the client's needs.

## **Task Four:** Machine Learning Production
- Implemented a Python module to train a model and generate performance metrics, facilitating the transition from model development to production environment.
